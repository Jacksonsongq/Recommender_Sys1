# Homework 2 – Restaurant Recommender Systems (Northwestern STAT 415)

A short, hands-on project that walks through **four classic approaches** to building a
restaurant recommendation engine:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – understand the users & restaurants  
2. **Popularity Matching** – “wisdom-of-the-crowd” baselines + empirical Bayes shrinkage  
3. **Content-Based Filtering** – numeric/categorical embeddings & distance metrics  
4. **Natural-Language Analysis** – _either_ Jaccard or TF-IDF similarity on menu text  

The final deliverable is a **PDF report** (visuals + narrative, no code) and the
accompanying **Python code** that generated those results.
